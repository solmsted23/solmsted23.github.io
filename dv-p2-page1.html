        <p>The Pacific Crest trail is a continuous hiking path that runs the length of the United States from Mexico to Canada. Hikers typically **, most Northbound hikers (NOBO) starting as early as March and finishing before major snowfall in Washington in by October. Roughly 2500 hikers set out each spring to hike NOBO, and roughly Â¼ are able to finish in a continuous thru-hike. Hikers average around 25 miles per day, hiking with an average of 5 days of food in between towns, and carry a base-weight around 13lbs (the weight of all of their gear minus food, water and fuel).
        The PCT hiker survey from Halfway anywhere compiles a survey for all who attempt a PCT thru-hike each year, and provide the results to future thru-hiking classes.
